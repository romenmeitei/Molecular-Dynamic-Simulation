# Molecular-Dynamic-Simulation
The protein_ligand.ipynb runs on Google Colab.
Please use the protein and ligand uploaded here.
Steps to run the Molecular Dynamic Simulation
1. Create a folder at Google Drive
2. Upload the protein and the ligand.
3. Open protein_ligand.ipynb and mount the Google drive.
4. Provide the path of the folder which contain the protein and ligand.
5. Run the script to proceed with the Molecular Dynamic Simulation.
